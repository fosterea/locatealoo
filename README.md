  <h2>What it does</h2>

<p>It's a map of restrooms that any user can add to. Users are also able to rate or report other listings. On top of having user-added restrooms on the map, the site displays chains like Starbucks automatically because all Starbucks have an open bathroom policy.</p>

<h2>What's next for Locate a Loo</h2>

<p>We will add more chains with open-bathroom policies. And we need more users to help add bathrooms around their town.</p>

<h2>Additional info:</h2>

<p>Now, instead of different colored markers to represent locations that are not added by users, the company logo is displayed.
It wasn't demonstrated in the video, but the "leave rating" function works by making a small form pop up and allowing the user to enter a number. The number is averaged with the rest of the ratings and displayed as the new rating. </p>
